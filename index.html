                <h3 class ="intro-text"> Welcome to BOOTCAMP! <br>My name is Colonel Brad and I have been training soldiers for the past 15 years. My job is to turn you from the Novice that you are into a seasoned experienced veteran like me. I'll be putting you through the paces right away with a series of general knowledge questions that any soldier at BOOTCAMP should know.<br>
                Get too many questions wrong and you fail BOOTCAMP. I have faith in you. Don't disappoint me.</h3>
